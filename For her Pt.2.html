	<h2>For Her.</h2>
	 <p><b>I know I’m kind of stealing your idea but when I was planning this out what better way to impress her than write a letter for her so, here we are. How original am I right. I know I might not be as good as you are when it comes to written language…or English in general but hang with me here limfaw.</b></p>
    
    <p><b>I hope by now u have realized what is going on but just in case you haven’t, exactly 35 days ago on a Thursday, we first hung out and we were on this garage listening to 16 by Baby Keem on your phone and sitting in shopping carts, munching on sweet as fuck snacks (diabetes I know) talking about cartoons on the stormiest day we could have ever picked to go out Lol.</b></p>

    <p><b>Even though when you think about it 35 days isn’t a lot, we have had so much fun and ill be honest in none of those days do I remember being uncomfortable around you, and even when you aren’t around, all I think about is your small ass. I would never think that I would feel this secure and this comfy with an absolutely stunning (smash)150 something cm tall woman with blue-ish green-ish eyes in which I have gotten lost into countless times. Every time she smiles I feel like there is a little ray of sunshine coming my way.</b></p>
    
    <p><b>This absolute amazing person who somehow has been there for me in this short amount of time more often than people I have known for years. Although fragile, you bring peace every time you hug me(not very “catalyst of chaos” of you now is it lol). This sweetheart that looks so cute and adorable and perfect with everything she does. Even though so emotional you still manage to have such great communicative skills that just amaze me every time you want to talk about something important with people. So genuine and thoughtful. So analytic about things (something I deadass couldn’t do for too long or my brain would commit aliven’t).</b></p>

    <p><b>I really feel like you are everything I had been looking for in such long time. Even though very different we somehow relate and actually connect so perfectly and the time when you said we are like Ying and yang always comes to mind and to be honest I feel like it is true.<br>
    I also adore the fact that you are independent and spontaneous like me because it gives you more of an open dynamic I think, makes everything more interesting. Also the fact that you plan about dates sometimes or even out of nowhere, and the 25th of Feb was so nice and I still think about it to this day (best date I have ever had on god W idea).</b></p>

    <p><b>It really feels nice to finally be able to talk to someone and not have to argue about it, just speak my mind once in a while you know. And of course, I really hope that you know that I will be here to listen to you about anything. I love when you talk about things that you love. Who would have thought that I would sit here and listen about what a motherfucker from ancient Greece said but didn’t write down (philosophy reference). I want you to really understand that I am someone you can vent to talk about nonsense to, someone you can trust, someone you can call your own and someone you can just sit there and eat chocolate ice cream while watching horror movies on the TV and petting our cat.</b></p>

    <p><b>Well then, what I’m trying to say is that I want you to be that one person I can consider as my forever person, and you already are one of my favorites so, since this was a bit out of my comfort zone, I thought why not do it properly…. but in the way I know best :).</b></p>
